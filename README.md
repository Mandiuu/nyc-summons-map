# The map of NYC 2023 summons 

*Methodology*

I started this story after living in New York for a couple of months and realizing that my biggest fear was not being robbed but encountering someone under the influence of drugs and alcohol or making more noise than I am used to. That's how I found the summons related to quality of life and fines for civil offenses.
To make my project more didactic and valuable to the user, I created an interactive map with the summons indexes in 5 categories I designed: alcohol/drugs, weapons, bikes, disobedience business, disorderly behavior, and noise. Using an address finder, people can type in a specific address and see the summons rates at particular locations in the five boroughs of New York City.

For this project, I used the following technologies and libraries:
Leaflet.js
D3.js
Papa Parse
GeoJSON
Fetch API
GSAP
Nominatim

*I struggle with*

One of the key challenges I've encountered is getting the addresses to consistently appear on the map. This functionality is still not working as seamlessly as I'd like, and I'm seeking your feedback to help improve it.
I filtered the data according to each category and realized that some were strings and others numbers.
The Popup management


*Next improvements*

Responsive design that makes the map fully responsive on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
One area that I'm particularly keen to improve is the search engine for addresses. I believe that enhancing this feature will significantly enhance the user experience.
Provide more insights into the data, such as trends over time or comparative analysis between precincts
